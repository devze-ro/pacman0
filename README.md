## Build & Run
Based on the OS, run the appropriate build script with the required flags. Run without the `-r` flag if you want to only build the game. Refer the script files for more details on the available build options.

On Windows:
```sh
build-window.bat -d -r
```

On Linux:
```sh
build-linux.sh -d -r
```

On MacOS:
```sh
build-osx.sh -d -r.
```
